# K-Nearest Neighbours

"""

• KNN is used for classification and regression and involves looking
at the k-nearest neighbors.
• Classification = categorization into a group.
• Regression = predicting a response (like a number).
• Feature extraction means converting an item (like a fruit or a user)
into a list of numbers that can be compared.
• Picking good features is an important part of a successful KNN
algorithm.

Introduction to Machine Learning:
ex:
1) OCR(optical character recognition)
2) Building a Spam Filter - uses a Naive Bayes Classifies Algorithm
